<p><strong>Prepared Coding Dojo: Ugly Trivia</strong>: This is a different format than the “randori” format we usually do. The randori involves people working in pairs on a problem. This format is a prepared kata.</p>

<p>Two people will be on the projector pairing on a problem. The problem will be the Ugly Trivia. We will show how to tackle this legacy code problem, alternatives, techniques, etc.</p>

<p>For the prepared kata format, you don’t need a laptop.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Serverless apps for NASA and GovCloud</strong>: I’m Chris Shenton, CTO of V! Studios located just outside Washington DC. I’ve been working with NASA for about 30 years, got into cloud about 7 years ago when we won a contract to build public/private/gov clouds for them in AWS. Since then we built https://images.nasa.gov­ with cloud-native tech, and a high-volume serverless-based OCR system for them. My LinkedIn profile:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/shentonfreude/­</p>

<p>I’ll presentat a talk I gave at the AWS Public Sector Summit in Washington DC this summer on how we are using Serverless at NASA; that ran about 20-25 minutes, and I overflowed the 10 minute Q&amp;A. I compare datacenters to classic cloud, then to serverless and show the advantages of going serverless, and how we’re solving real world safety problems for NASA. It closes with some security concerns NASA had but that would likely apply to most enterprises.</p>

<p><strong>Learn how to code and make architecture simpler with Michael Feathers</strong>: Many systems are full of error checks and conditional logic. They introduce discontinuities that make reasoning difficult. In this talk, Michael Feathers will present a conceptual framework for dealing with errors, conditionality and decision making at the level of code, architecture and user interface. Often by changing the design and revisiting requirements we can make various error cases impossible, and make code and architecture simpler as well as more robust.</p>

<p>Over the years, Michael has spent a significant amount of time helping teams gain control over large codebases in C, C++, C#, Java, and Ruby. He was involved in the early Agile movement and one of his passions is helping organizations recognize the impact of their internal organization and communication on the long term viability of their software products – putting interactions in place to prevent the accumulation of technical debt and lost business opportunities.
Currently, he’s helping teams and pursuing research in business/development communication, preventing errors through design practice and array-functional programming languages. His goal is to make software development more effective and integrated with business concerns.
He is also the author of the book ‘Working Effectively with Legacy Code’
Michael Specialties are Software Development Practices, TDD, Refactoring, Legacy Code Revitalization, Team Dynamics.</p>

<p>Michael doesn’t want to miss the opportunity to share his knowledge with the community and Voxel Group, and kindly host the meetup.</p>
